# bunyedit: worldedit for bunys


hi! this is a minecraft mod for better than adventure. it's my own take on a
worldedit-like :)

it works as a mod and as a "server plugin": you have to install the mod on the client to
use it in singleplayer, but only the server needs it in multiplayer.

here's a video showing some features:

someone is already doing this (it's called
[bta-worldedit](https://github.com/FatherCheese/bta-worldedit)) but i wanted to try it
myself. thank you to the author of that for inspiration!

this is not a fork of either worldedit or bta-worldedit, but i have read bits of their
code.

## differences from bta-worldedit

1. the cursor in bunyedit uses left/right click and works from a distance like original
   worldedit. the wand in bta-worldedit uses right/shift-right click and requires that
   the block is in reach. the former feels more familiar to me, but forces bunyedit to
   mixin a little more invasively.
2. bunyedit is heavily inspired by worldedit but i won't shy away from doing my own take
   on things. bta-worldedit seems to be very much going for replicating the same
   interface as worldedit.
3. bunyedit tries its best to play nice with tile entities.
